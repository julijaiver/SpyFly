INSTRUCTIONS :

You will start in a random airport within your selected continent. Your objective is to gain as many points as you can within your continent before you run out of fuel or get caught.

You gain points when you land in an airport and you can choose another airport to fly to.

Every airport will have one of 4 possible weather conditions - each will have a different effect, which you will have to discover when playing.

You can only visit each airport once, and you can only visit airports that are within your range.
